# Hochschule

Welcome to my personal University Code Showcase repository! This repository is my space to casually showcase selected university project code. Feel free to explore the projects, and keep in mind that adherence to style guides, best practices, and other formalities might be widely ignored for many tasks.

## Organization

```
/Hochschule
|-- module1
|   |-- task1
|   |   |-- file.py
|   |   `-- file.cs
|   `-- task2
|-- module2
|   `-- ...
`-- README.md
```

## Notes

**Style Guides, Best Practices, Performance, etc.:** For many tasks, these might (and will) take a back seat. This code is solely used to perform a certain action, fullfill a task or provide some value. This is a space for exploration and expression rather than strict adherence to guidelines.

Enjoy exploring the code! If you have any questions or need assistance, feel free to reach out.
